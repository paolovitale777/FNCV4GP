# FNCV4GP
Fast Nested Cross-Validation for Genomic Prediction

# Description
This is Python-based, user-friendly software for performing Nested Cross-Validation to optimize tuning for a wide range of models.

# Key Features 
1) Marker filtering
2) Running a Nested Cross-Validation for a wide range of models
3) Summary of the results   

# Inputs
• Marker filtering
1) Hapmap or Numerical matrix coded 2 (major Homozygous), 0 (minor Homozygous), and 1 (Heterozygous)

• Nested CV
1) Numerical matrix coded 2 (major Homozygous), 0 (minor Homozygous), and 1 (Heterozygous)
2) Adjusted mean trait values such as best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs)

• Summary 
1) Outputs from Nested CV modules
